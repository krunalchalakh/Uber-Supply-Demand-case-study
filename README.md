# Uber-Supply-Demand-case-study
Problem Statement>>
Visually identify the most pressing problems for Uber. 
Hint: Create plots to visualise the frequency of requests that get cancelled or show 'no cars available'; identify the most problematic 
types of requests (city to airport / airport to city etc.) and the time slots (early mornings, late evenings etc.) using plots
Find out the gap between supply and demand and show the same using plots.
Find the time slots when the highest gap exists
Find the types of requests (city-airport or airport-city) for which the gap is the most severe in the identified time slots
What do you think is the reason for this issue for the supply-demand gap? Write the answer in less than 100 words. You may accompany 
the write-up with plot(s).
 Recommend some ways to resolve the supply-demand gap.
Present the problem, the analyses and the recommendations using plots to the Chief Data Scientist in a well-formatted presentation 
(make sure to submit a PDF version of the PPT). Also, include a commented jupyter Notebook in your submission. Please note that the 
assignment has to be done completely in Python including the plots. However, you may recreate the plots in Tableau to include in the 
presentation.
